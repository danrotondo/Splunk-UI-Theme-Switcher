**SplunkUIThemeSwitcher** is a Figma plugin that simplifies design workflows by allowing you to quickly switch between different Theme, Color Mode, and Density settings for all Splunk UI (SUI) library components on the current page. This is especially useful for designers working with the Enterprise theme, as it enables a seamless transition from the default Prisma theme.

Currently, this plugin is compatible with the 3.x and 4.x versions of the Splunk UI Library.

The plugin can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1413282839021749569/splunkuithemeswitcher) (note this currently only available on the Splunk Figma tenant).
